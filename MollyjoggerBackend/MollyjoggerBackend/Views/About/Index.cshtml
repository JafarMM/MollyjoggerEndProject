                                Mollyjogger,® is an authentic heritage brand, based in the Ozark Mountains, <br>
                                celebrating the region’s unique history of outdoor recreation and folklore. <br>
                                Adopting the name Mollyjogger from the original Mollyjoggers Fishing & Hunting <br>
                                Club, circa 1890; their Spring and Fall excursions included wagons loaded with <br>
                                provisions, bird dogs and a camp cook. Members filled their days with hunting <br>
                                and fishing, and evenings with campfire tales.

                                Considerable curiosity has often been expressed why the name of “Mollyjoggers” was adopted by this <br>
                                club. Like the odd and catchy names of other associations, formed for either business or pleasure, it was <br>
                                merely a matter of accident. The club was camped at one time at what is known as Gibson hole, and were <br>
                                celebrating the feast day of the week—Friday, when they were joined by a neighboring mountaineer, who <br>
                                came to spend the evening. He was made to feel at home, invited to participate in the many good things <br>
                                to eat and drink, and hugely enjoyed the fun and good stories. Late in the evening, as he was about to <br>
                                depart for home, he stepped in the tent door and addressed his host as follows:
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                “I’ve knowned you ’uns fer many a year in your stores in town, and never ’lowed they wus any fun in ye, <br>
                                but out here on the crick ye are jest like a lot of Mollyjoggers.”
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                For those who are not familiar with the different species of the finny tribe found in the Ozarks streams, <br>
                                it will perhaps be interesting to know that there is a minnow inhabiting these waters—a horny-headed, <br>
                                spotted fellow, who is absolutely worthless, not even tempting the versatile appetite of gars and turtles <br>
                                when used as bait, and this fish is called by the natives the “mollyjogger.” What the old mountaineer said <br>
                                that evening struck home, and the name was adopted at once. <br>
